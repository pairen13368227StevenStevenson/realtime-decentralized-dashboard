# Our Core Values: Transaction-incentivized Liquidity Pools & Decentralized Innovation

This document outlines the core values and principles behind the Datamine Network, focusing on its unique approach to liquidity pools, tokenomics, and continuous innovation with new features like Datamine Market and Datamine Gems.

![Our Use Case: Transaction-incentivized Liquidity Pools](../../helpArticles/assets/images/svgs/synergy.svg#_className=rightIcon)
DAM, FLUX, ArbiFLUX, and LOCK are interconnected tokens that offer unique incentives for providing liquidity on Uniswap & Balancer pools. Our core on-chain use case ensures constant movement of tokens through any liquidity pool, driving monetary velocity and decentralized demand.

Datamine (DAM) tokens have fixed supply to form high volatility pool. Over 70% of lifetime DAM supply is located in the FLUX minting smart contract. Constant demand to start more validators creates on-chain velocity.

FLUX tokens have infinite supply and deflation is automatically adjusted by "controlled on-chain burn" to create low volatility pool. Over 60% of all FLUX tokens have been destroyed from circulation creating on-chain velocity where FLUX is used as a form of "fuel" for the controlled burn. The introduction of ArbiFLUX and LOCK further refines this deflationary mechanism and enhances liquidity.

## On-Chain Linear Deflation & Dynamic Ecosystem
FLUX can only be generated by starting a validator with DAM tokens. FLUX is generated in a linear & predictable manner every 12 seconds. FLUX mint ratio scales linearly based on the amount of FLUX destroyed from circulation. With the addition of ArbiFLUX and LOCK, the ecosystem now features multi-layered minting and burning mechanisms that contribute to overall stability and efficiency.

Uniswap and Balancer act as M0 money pools in our DeFi ecosystem. FLUX is constantly "re-cycled" through the liquidity pools via FLUX burning & Minting cycles. With no DAM inflation and controlled FLUX deflation, and the unique liquidity-enhancing properties of LOCK, our liquidity pools offer high transaction throughput and robust market depth.
